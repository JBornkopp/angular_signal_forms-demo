# AngularSignalFormsDemo Watchlist

This project contains two implementations for a movie watchlist. One was implemented with Reactive Forms and the other one with Signal Forms.

## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.
